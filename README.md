# Beta-star
This repository focuses on a measure of inter-specific measure of phenotypic overlap called “beta-star.” Beta-star measures phenotypic overlap between pairs of species in continuous multivariate phenotypic space, assuming each species is approximately described by a normal distribution. Beta-star is defined as the proportion of individuals of each species contained within the most inclusive pair of highest density regions that are i) non-overlapping and ii) equal in coverage (for a useful discussion of highest density regions see: Hyndman (1996. Computing and graphing highest density regions. The American Statistician 50: 120-126). This metric has only been implicitly included in a previous publication (Zapata and Jiménez, 2012. Species delimitation: inferring gaps in morphology across geography. Systematic biology 61: 179-194), and its properties have not been discussed.
